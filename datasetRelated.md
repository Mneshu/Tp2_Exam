The datasets i used are related to a Two-Pot System which are " Louisville_Metro_KY_-_Employee_Salary_Data.csv " and "mortgage-status.csv", but while the datasets do not directly mention a two-pot system, they are inherently related through their focus on employee compensation and could provide valuable insights into how the workforce might perceive or utilize a two-pot savings system

Why the Datasets May Be Relevant
Employee Compensation: Both datasets contain information about employee salaries and other forms of compensation. Understanding these financial details could provide insights into how employees manage their finances, which is crucial for participation in a two-pot system.

Financial Behavior Insights: By analyzing salaries, bonuses, and other compensation components, we can infer how employees might prioritize spending and saving. This could relate to how they choose to allocate their funds in a two-pot system.

Demographic Context: The first dataset provides demographic information that can help understand how different groups within the workforce may utilize a two-pot system differently based on their financial situations.
